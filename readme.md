# üìà Stock Price Forecasting Pipeline (Airflow + Snowflake + YFinance)

This project implements a **fully automated data pipeline** for stock price forecasting using **Apache Airflow**, **Snowflake**, and the **YFinance API**.  
It retrieves historical stock data, stores it securely in Snowflake, and predicts future prices using **Snowflake‚Äôs ML forecasting** features.

---

## üß† Overview

The pipeline consists of two main **Airflow DAGs**:

1. **`fetch_stock_price_dag.py`** ‚Äî Fetches and stores the latest 180 days of stock data.  
2. **`forecast_stock_price_dag.py`** ‚Äî Runs forecasting on the stored data and writes the predictions back to Snowflake.

Both DAGs are orchestrated in Airflow to run on a schedule, enabling **automated, continuous updates** of both raw and forecasted stock data.

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system integrates four core components:

- **YFinance API** ‚Äì Data source for real-time and historical market data  
- **Apache Airflow** ‚Äì Workflow orchestration for ETL and ML tasks  
- **Snowflake** ‚Äì Cloud data warehouse for storage, transformation, and forecasting  
- **Docker** ‚Äì Containerized environment for Airflow and PostgreSQL setup  

### **Workflow Summary**
1. Airflow triggers data ingestion from YFinance.  
2. Raw stock data is loaded into Snowflake.  
3. Snowflake performs ELT transformations and time-series forecasting.  
4. Forecasted prices are written to a final table for analytics and visualization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Airflow DAGs

### 1. Data Ingestion ‚Äî `fetch_stock_price_dag.py`
- Fetches 180 days of OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for multiple tickers.  
- Cleans and transforms the data.  
- Loads into the **`STOCK_PRICES`** table in Snowflake.  
- Scheduled to run daily.

### 2. Forecasting ‚Äî `forecast_stock_price_dag.py`
- Reads the latest stock data from Snowflake.  
- Applies time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA or `ML.FORECAST()` in Snowflake).  
- Stores results in the **`STOCK_FORECAST`** table.  
- Produces 7-day ahead forecasts.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

| Component | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| **Apache Airflow** | DAG orchestration, task scheduling |

## üöÄ Setup & Deployment

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VaheedurRehman/stock-forecasting-pipeline.git
cd stock-forecasting-pipeline
```

### 2. Configure Airflow
Place both DAG files inside your Airflow `dags/` directory:
```
fetch_stock_price_dag.py
forecast_stock_price_dag.py
```

Update **Airflow connections**:
- `snowflake_default` ‚Üí Your Snowflake credentials  
- `yfinance_api` ‚Üí Optional (if using a custom connection wrapper)

### 3. Configure Snowflake
Run the following SQL commands in Snowflake to create tables:
```sql
CREATE TABLE STOCK_PRICES (
  SYMBOL STRING,
  DATE DATE,
  OPEN FLOAT,
  HIGH FLOAT,
  LOW FLOAT,
  CLOSE FLOAT,
  VOLUME FLOAT
);

CREATE TABLE STOCK_FORECAST (
  SYMBOL STRING,
  DATE DATE,
  PREDICTED_CLOSE FLOAT
);
```

### 4. Start the Airflow Environment
If using Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 5. Trigger DAGs
Access the Airflow UI (`http://localhost:8080`):
- Enable `fetch_stock_price_dag`
- Enable `forecast_stock_price_dag`

## üìä Outputs

After successful execution:

- **STOCK_PRICES** ‚Üí Historical data  
- **`STOCK_FORECAST`** ‚Üí 7-day forecasted prices  
- Combined results available for visualization or dashboarding  


---

## üß© Example SQL Queries

```sql
-- View historical prices
SELECT * FROM STOCK_PRICES WHERE SYMBOL = 'AAPL' ORDER BY DATE DESC;

-- View forecasted prices
SELECT * FROM STOCK_FORECAST WHERE SYMBOL = 'AAPL' ORDER BY DATE DESC;

-- Combine actual and predicted data
SELECT p.SYMBOL, p.DATE, p.CLOSE, f.PREDICTED_CLOSE
FROM STOCK_PRICES p
JOIN STOCK_FORECAST f
ON p.SYMBOL = f.SYMBOL AND p.DATE = f.DATE;
```
